Email Spam Classification
This project classifies emails as spam or not spam using a machine learning model based on the Naive Bayes algorithm. The email texts are vectorized using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) technique to convert the text data into numerical form before applying the classification model.

Dataset
The dataset used contains two columns:

label: Indicates whether the email is spam (1) or not spam (0).
text: The body of the email.
Project Workflow
Data Loading and Preprocessing

The dataset is loaded using pandas.
Basic information about the dataset is displayed using .head() and .info().
Checks for missing values and class distribution.
A new feature, word_count, is added to analyze the length of emails in terms of the number of words.
TF-IDF Vectorization

A TfidfVectorizer is used to convert the email text into numerical form.
The maximum number of features used by the vectorizer is set to 3000.
Splitting the Dataset

The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets using train_test_split.
Model Selection and Training

A Naive Bayes model (MultinomialNB) is selected due to its effectiveness in text classification tasks.
The model is trained on the training data.
Evaluation

The modelâ€™s accuracy on the test data is evaluated using:
Accuracy Score
Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
Confusion Matrix with a heatmap for visualization.
Spam Classification Example

A sample email text is classified as spam or not spam using the trained model.
Metrics

Accuracy of the model: 95%
F1 score: Calculated and displayed in the output.
Files
email_text.csv: The dataset used for training and testing.
spam_classification.py: The Python script containing the complete code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.
Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/email-spam-classification.git
cd email-spam-classification
Install the required Python libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
Ensure the dataset (email_text.csv) is in the project directory.

Usage
Run the Python script:

bash
Copy code
python spam_classification.py
The model will output the accuracy, classification report, confusion matrix, and F1 score. You can also classify new emails by modifying the new_email variable in the script.

Visualization
The confusion matrix is visualized as a heatmap using Seaborn:


Model Performance
Accuracy: 95%
F1 Score: Displayed in the output.
Conclusion
The Naive Bayes model performs well on this dataset, achieving a high accuracy in classifying emails as spam or not spam. The use of TF-IDF vectorization effectively converts the email text into numerical features suitable for the Naive Bayes algorithm.
